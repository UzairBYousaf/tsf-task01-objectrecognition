# tsf-task01-objectrecognition

This was my first task as a Computer Vision & IoT intern at The Sparks Foundation, in this task I was asked to implement real-time object detection using any approach, my approach was to load an already pre-trained MobileNetSSD model into OpenCV's DNN function as it not only it was light weight for the CPU but also manageable in size.

Code files along with any necessary models or weight files can be downloaded here as GitHub cannot support files larger than 25MB: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UIfCvYyuhWiJtqedCXYNA7OfR1KYbnl0?usp=sharing

Moreover a video demonstration of this code can be viewed on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q7OlLJOmV0

I'm open to any suggestions, criticisms and opinions especially from my fellow interns.
